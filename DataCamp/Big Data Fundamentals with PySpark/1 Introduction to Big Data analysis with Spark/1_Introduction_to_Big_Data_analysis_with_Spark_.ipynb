The general syntax of the filter() function is `filter(function, list_of_input)`. Similar to the map(), filter() can be used with lambda() function. The general syntax of the filter() function with lambda() is `filter(lambda <argument>:<expression>, list)`. Refer to slide 6 of video 1.7 for general help of the filter() function with lambda().\r\n",
